Customer need to sign up and login (google authentication)
He can see the movie list with date time range
If he chooses a movie with a certain time and date, then should be able to see 40 seats as icons, each icon is clickable.
Available seat and booked seat will have different color
If a seat is booked, then icon won't be clickable
He can only booked the seat which has not booked yet
A person can book upto 10 seat at a time
If all the seat has been bookend, there should be an message “House is full”
